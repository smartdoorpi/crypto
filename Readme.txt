1. Compilation command - gcc rsa.c -o rsa -lm
2. Run using ./rsa command


Example:
Enter any two prime numbers: 1
2
Enter some numerical plaintext: 23
Value of e: 2
Value of d: 3

The cipher text is: 1 with excryption time: 0.004000 ms

The decrypted text is: 1 with decryption time: 0.004000 ms

CRT(Chinese Remainder Theorem) Parameters are as below:
dP=2, dQ=2, qInv=2

The decrypted text with CRT is: 1 and decryption time : 0.003000 ms
